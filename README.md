## Export processing videos with FFmpeg, (instead of saving single frames)

Taken from the plugin version at ![video_export_processing](https://github.com/hamoid/video_export_processing)

To use it in your sketch, copy the VideoExport.java file, import the class,
create it with PApplet parent, startFfmpeg, and then saveFrame's on draw.
